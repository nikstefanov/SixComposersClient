The Hershberger Assay consists of androgenic and anti-androgenic components.  To screen for potential androgenic activity, [chemical name (% purity, batch/lot #)] in [vehicle] was administered daily via [oral gavage or subcutaneous (s.c.)] to [#]-day old, castrated male [strain] rats at dose levels of 0 (vehicle), [#] or [#] mg/kg/day.  An androgenic positive control group consisted of # castrated rats exposed to [#]mg/kg/day testosterone propionate (TP) by s.c. injection.

To screen for potential anti-androgenic activity [chemical name (% purity, batch/lot #)] in [vehicle]  was administered daily via [oral gavage or subcutaneous (s.c.)] to [#]-day old, castrated male [strain] rats at dose levels of 0 (vehicle), [#],[#] or [#] mg/kg/day in conjunction with a daily dose of reference androgen TP at [#] mg/kg/day by s.c. injection.  An anti-androgenic positive control group consisted of [#] castrated rats exposed to [#] mg/kg/day TP and [#] mg/kg/day flutamide (FT).  TP alone was used as the anti-androgenic negative control.

For both components of the assay, the animals were dosed for 10 consecutive days and necropsied approximately 24 hours after the final dose administration to determine weights of the five androgen-dependent tissues.

Report doses and routes of administration for positive controls (e.g., TP, FT, both) and whether or not controls functioned as anticipated.  Include a brief summary of the results and a conclusion regarding the anti- and androgenic activity of the test substance.  Anti androgenic activity is typically indicated by a statistically significant decrease in two or more target organ weights of the treated groups (test substance + TP) compared to the TP only control group.  Androgenic activity is typically indicated by a significant increase in two or more organ weights compared to the vehicle control.  Report any additional data that corroborate or confound the interpretation of the organ weight data.  Include results from additional toxicity information.
