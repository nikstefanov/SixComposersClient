				<span style="color:firebrick">[15]</span> rats/sex/dose group were administered the test substance
				in corn oil via gavage at doses of 0, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day from PND <span style="color:firebrick">[23 53]</span>.
				At 1000 mg/kg/day, body weights were significantly decreased by 15 18% (p&lt;0.05)
				compared to controls beginning on PND 42, resulting in a decrease of 16% p&lt;0.05)
				in terminal body weight.  Body weights at 500 mg/kg/day were comparable to controls
				throughout the study.  There were no mortalities, clinical signs of toxicity,
				or effects on BUN or creatinine at either dose.</p>

				identification (laboratory report or MRID number), study type (i.e., duration,

				The second dose level should typically be spaced to produce a lesser degree of
				toxicity relative to the high dose unless justification is provided for testing at a different level.
