	                Report mortality and assess whether animal deaths were due to treatment with the test substance.
	                If treatment-related mortality occurred, the assay should have been repeated at lower doses because
	                the maximum tolerated dose was exceeded.  However, mortality may occur that is unrelated to treatment
	                (e.g., due to gavage error or occurring at the low dose but not at the high dose).
	                Nevertheless, the impact that these deaths have on the assay???s interpretation and
	                acceptability should be carefully scrutinized because smaller sample sizes resulting
	                from mortality reduces the power to discern statistically significant differences.
