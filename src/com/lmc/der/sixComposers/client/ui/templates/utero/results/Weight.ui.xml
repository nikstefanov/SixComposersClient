				Some form of the following tables is mandatory.
				At a minimum, body weights should be reported for the first and final days of
				dosing, along with the body weight gain for the overall study (Days 1 3 or 1 7).
				Additionally, data from any days on which statistically significant decreases in
				body weights were observed should be included in the table to highlight treatment-related effects.
				Any effects of treatment on body weights should be described in text,
				including information on statistical significance, magnitude difference
				from controls, and the onset and duration of the decreases.
				Treatment-related, statistically significant decreases in body weights of &gt;10%
				compared to controls can indicate excessive toxicity and may affect
				the acceptability of the assay.
