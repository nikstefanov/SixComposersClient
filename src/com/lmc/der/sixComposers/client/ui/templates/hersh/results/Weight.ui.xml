		                    Body weights in the low- and mid-dose groups were comparable

		            Some form of the following table is mandatory. At a minimum, body weights should be
		            reported for the first and final days of dose administration, along with body weight gain
		            for the overall study (Days 1-10).  Additionally, data from any days on which statistically
		            significant decreases in body weights were observed should be included in the table to
		            highlight treatment-related effects.  Any effects of treatment on body weights should be
		            described in text, including information on statistical significance, magnitude difference from
		            controls, and the onset and duration of the decreases.
		            Treatment-related, statistically significant decreases in body weights off&gt;10% compared to
		            controls constitute excessive toxicity and may affect the acceptability of the assay.
