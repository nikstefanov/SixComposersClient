<p>In a Female Pubertal Assay (MRID <span style="color:firebrick">[number] (if applicable)</span>), <span style="color:firebrick">[#] [strain]</span> rats/dose group were treated daily via <span style="color:firebrick">[oral gavage]</span> with <span style="color:firebrick">[chemical name (% purity, batch/lot #)]</span> in <span style="color:firebrick">[vehicle]</span> at doses of <span style="color:firebrick">[0] ([vehicle]), [#] or [#]</span> mg/kg/day from post-natal day (PND) <span style="color:firebrick">[22] to [42]</span>.  Animals were examined for vaginal opening daily beginning on PND 22, and weight at day of attainment was recorded.  Following sacrifice on PND <span style="color:firebrick">[42] or [43]</span>, total thyroxine (T4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were analyzed using a <span style="color:firebrick">[type]</span> assay.  Urogenital organ weights were recorded, and microscopic examination of the <span style="color:firebrick">[ovaries, uterus, thyroid, liver, pituitary, adrenal and kidneys]</span> were performed.
