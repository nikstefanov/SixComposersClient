<p>In a Male Pubertal Assay (MRID <span style="color:firebrick">[number] (if applicable)</span>), <span style="color:firebrick">[#] [strain]</span> rats/dose group were treated daily via <span style="color:firebrick">[oral gavage]</span> with <span style="color:firebrick">[chemical name (% purity, batch/lot #)]</span> in <span style="color:firebrick">[vehicle]</span> at doses of 0 <span style="color:firebrick">([vehicle]), [#]</span> or <span style="color:firebrick">[#]</span> mg/kg/day from post-natal day (PND) <span style="color:firebrick">[23] to [53]</span>.  Animals were examined for preputial separation (PPS) daily beginning on PND 30 and weight at day of attainment was recorded.  Following sacrifice on <span style="color:firebrick">PND [53] or [54]</span>, total serum testosterone, thyroxine (T4), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were analyzed using a <span style="color:firebrick">[type]</span> assay.  Urogenital organ weights were recorded and microscopic examination of the <span style="color:firebrick">[testes, epididymides, prostate, thyroid, and kidneys]</span> were performed.</p>
