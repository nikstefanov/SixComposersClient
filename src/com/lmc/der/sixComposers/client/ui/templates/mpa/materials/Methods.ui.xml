		This is the information that you would be found in the study report conducted following
		guideline recommendations. Thyroid sections are subjectively evaluated for follicular cell
		height and colloid area, preferably using a five point grading scale
		(1 = shortest/smallest; 5 = tallest/largest), and any abnormalities/lesions noted.
		At least two sections from each of the two lobes of the thyroid should be examined in order
		to obtain representative sample of the thyroid tissue from each lobe.  Guidance related to
		the histological evaluation of the testis and epididymis is given in EPA’s
		Health Effects Test Guideline OPPTS 870.3800: Reproduction and Fertility Effects (US EPA, 1998).
		Report the histopathological findings in Section II.F.
