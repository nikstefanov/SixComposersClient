The 21-day assay of
<span style="color:firebrick">[test chemical]</span>
on amphibian metamorphosis of
<span style="color:firebrick">[common name and scientific name]</span>
was studied under
<span style="color:firebrick">[flow-through/static-renewal]</span>
conditions.  Amphibian larvae
<span style="color:firebrick">[enter number of larvae used and age or stage of development]</span>
were exposed to
<span style="color:firebrick">[control, solvent control (if applicable), and test chemical nominal/measured concentrations]</span>
of
<span style="color:firebrick">[x1, x2, x3, .... xn]</span>
mg a.i./L.  The test system was maintained at
<span style="color:firebrick">[...]</span>
to
<span style="color:firebrick">[...]</span>
&deg;C and a pH of
<span style="color:firebrick">[...]</span>
to
<span style="color:firebrick">[...].</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color:firebrick"><i>[Modify as appropriate.]</i>  [Test chemical]</span>
significantly 
<span style="color:firebrick">[increased or decreased]</span>
7-day hind-limb length (HLL) at 
<span style="color:firebrick">[list all relevant concentrations]</span>
mg a.i./L and 21-day HLL at
<span style="color:firebrick">[list all relevant concentrations]</span>
mg a.i./L.  Significant 
<span style="color:firebrick">[acceleration or delay]</span>
of median Nieuwkoop-Faber (NF) developmental stage was observed at 7 days at 
<span style="color:firebrick">[list all relevant concentrations]</span>
mg a.i./L  and at 21 days at 
<span style="color:firebrick">[list all relevant concentrations]</span>
mg a.i./L.  Asynchronous development was observed in 
<span style="color:firebrick">[list number of tadpoles affected and the relevant concentration for each treatment level where asynchrony was observed]</span>
. Effects on thyroid gland histopathology were observed at 
<span style="color:firebrick">[list all relevant concentrations]</span>
mg a.i./L.   Histopathological effects included 
<span style="color:firebrick">......... [provide details of treatment-related effects, e.g., increased incidence of follicular cell hyperplasia]</span>
.  Clinical signs (i.e., behavioral and other sublethal effects) including 
<span style="color:firebrick">[discoloration, lethargy, loss of equilibrium, etc.]</span>
were observed in
<span style="color:firebrick">[number of tadpoles]</span>
at
<span style="color:firebrick">[each relevant concentration]</span>
mg a.i./L.  Unless otherwise indicated, all effects are reported based on comparison to the negative (clean water) control.
